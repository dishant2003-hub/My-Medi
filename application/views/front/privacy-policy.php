				DATA SECURITY</h3>
			We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information from
			loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email

			be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via
			email.<br>
			<h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 20px;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
				LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)</h3>
			If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the
			personal information described in this Policy depends on the personal information concerned and the specific
			context in which we collect it.<br>
			We may process your personal information because:<br>
			<ul style="margin-left:40px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
				<li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
				<li>You have given us permission to do so</li>
				<li>The processing is in our legitimate interests and it is not overridden by your rights</li>
				<li>For payment processing purposes</li>
				<li>To comply with the law</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 20px;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
				INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
			The Website is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Website from the European Union, Asia,
			or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, please
			be aware that you are transferring your personal data to the United States and you consent to that
			transfer.<br>
			<h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 20px;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
				DATA RETENTION</h3>
			We will retain personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
			Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.<br>
			<h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 20px;margin: 0px;padding: 0px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
				YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</h3>
			If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you
			wish to be informed about what personal data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our
			systems, please contact us.<br>
			In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:<br>
			<ul style="margin-left:40px;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
				<li>The right to access, update, or delete the personal data we have on you.</li>
				<li>The right of rectification. You have the right to have your personal data rectified if it is
					inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
				<li>The right to object. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data.</li>
				<li>The right of restriction. You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your
					personal data.</li>
				<li>The right to data portability. You have the right to be provided with a copy of your personal data
					in a structured, machine-readable, and commonly used format.</li>
				<li>The right to withdraw consent. You also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we
					rely on your consent to process your personal data.</li>
			</ul>
			Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.<br>
			You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
			However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.
			Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.<br>
			We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
			to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
			that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.<br>
			We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a
			month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
			notify you and keep you updated.<br>
